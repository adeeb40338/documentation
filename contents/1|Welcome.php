\h1_pb{Hi!}

Welcome to the AAL & ACTLab Documentation website! I created this site to provide documentation
on using two Arduino C++ libraries that I built as part of my 3rd year undergraduate research project
in control engineering.

\n|\n|

The cool thing about this website is that the content is sourced from simple text files (albeit with a
'.php' extension) organised within folders that determine the structure of the documentation. The idea
was to create a website whose content can easily be written by engineering academics with no website
development knowledge. Given the target audience, LaTeX was used as an inspiration for the language to
write up the website's content. With LaTeX like scripting, the user can choose heading sizes, create highlighted
boxes and even insert code.

\boxGreen{
	
	Please navigate this documenation using the menu on the left.

}

\boxRed{
	
	\h3_pb{\b{Menu Bug:}}

	\n|

	You may have noticed that the menu on the left is not in order - it's a (simple) bug. The order should be:
	Welcome, Getting Started, ACTLab Library, AAL Library and finally contact.

}

\boxGrey{
	
	\h3_pb{\b{NB:}}

	\n|

	This particular website is not the actual documentation for either of the AAL or ACTLab libraries.
	It is instead a showcase for this documentation web application.
